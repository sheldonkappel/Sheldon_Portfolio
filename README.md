For this project, I pulled data from a database of online chess games stored by Lichess, an online chess playing platform. The data though was in what is called a PNG format (portable game notation). This type of file is used to store information specifically about chess games. With python, I converted this data to a usable CSV format and then performed some more extensive cleaning. From there, I performed a few visualizations, including looking at the distribution of the ranks of players  for different opening types.

## [Project 2: COVID Data Exploration in SQL](https://github.com/sheldonkappel/COVID_data_exploration)

In this project, I created two CSV files (one about COVID deaths and one about COVID vaccinations) from a dataset concerning COVID from 
[ourworldindata.org](https://ourworldindata.org/). I then performed some exploratory data analysis to display for instance the continents with the highest death count per capita, percentage of population that have received at least one COVID vaccine, and the countries with the highest infection rate compared to the population, among other things.
