# Sheldon Kappel Data Analyst Portfolio

**Hi, my name is Sheldon. I am a recent graduate from The Ohio State University with a degree in Statistics and am looking for a job as a junior data analyst. I created this portfolio to demonstrate some of my skills with SQL and Python. You can find me on Linkedin at [https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheldon-kappel/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sheldon-kappel/) and my email is sheldonkappel@gmail.com.**

## [Project 1: Chess Games Mini Analysis in Python](https://github.com/sheldonkappel/chess_mini_analysis)
<img src = "images/chess.jpg" alt = "" width = "500" height = "330.7">

For this project, I pulled data from a database of online chess games stored by Lichess, an online chess playing platform. The data was in a PNG (portable game notation) format. This type of file is used to store information specifically about chess games. With python, I converted this data to a usable CSV format and then performed some more extensive cleaning. From there, I performed a few visualizations, including the distribution of the ranks of players for different opening types as well as effect of time control on these games.

## [Project 2: COVID-19 Data Exploration in SQL](https://github.com/sheldonkappel/COVID_data_exploration)

In this project, I created two CSV files (one about COVID-19 deaths and one about COVID-19 vaccinations) from a data compiled at [https://ourworldindata.org/](https://ourworldindata.org/). I then performed an exploratory data analysis to display the continents with the highest death count per capita, percentage of population that have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine, and the countries with the highest infection rate compared to the population, among other figures.

## [Project 3: Analysis of Car Accidents in the US in Python](https://github.com/sheldonkappel/us_car_accidents_mini_analysis)

This project consisted of some exploratory data analysis and visualization with the python plotly package. Some examples of questions I answered with this project were:
* What times of the day have the most car accidents?
* How does the number of accidents fluctuate throughout the week?
* How does the number of accidents per capita look across the states?
* How does the total number of accidents vary across the states?

## [Project 4: Nashville Housing Data Cleaning in SQL](https://github.com/sheldonkappel/nashville_housing_data_cleaning/tree/main)
<img src = "images/house_photo.jpg" alt = "">

In this project I took a dataset concerning houses in Nashville and performed some cleaning of it in SQL. Some examples tasks I performed were handling NULL values, splitting the full address into three separate columns for address, city, and state, and removing duplicate rows.

## [Project 5: Time Series Analysis for Number of Sunspots in R (School Project)](https://github.com/sheldonkappel/sunspots_time_series_analysis)
<img src = "images/nasa-JHyiw_dpALk-unsplash.jpg" alt = "">

Here, I analyzed the fluctuations of the number of sunspots from 1950 until now and then created and tested some predictions.
