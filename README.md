## [Project 1: Chess Games Mini Analysis in Python](https://github.com/sheldonkappel/chess_mini_analysis)

For this project, I pulled data from a database of online chess games stored by Lichess, an online chess playing platform. The data though was in what is called a PNG format (portable game notation). This type of file is used to store information specifically about chess games. With python, I converted this data to a usable CSV format and then performed some more extensive cleaning. From there, I performed a few visualizations, including looking at the distribution of the ranks of players  for different opening types.

## [Project 2: COVID Data Exploration in SQL](https://github.com/sheldonkappel/COVID_data_exploration)

In this project, I created two CSV files (one about COVID deaths and one about COVID vaccinations) from a dataset concerning COVID. I then performed some exploratory data analysis to display for instance the continents with the highest death count per capita, percentage of population that have received at least one COVID vaccine, and the countries with the highest infection rate compared to the population, among other things.

## [Project 3: Analysis of Car Accidents in the US in Python](https://github.com/sheldonkappel/us_car_accidents_mini_analysis)

This project consisted of some exploratory data analysis and visualization with the python plotly package. Some examples of questions I answered with this project were:
* What times of the day have the most car accidents?
* How does the number of accidents fluctuate throughout the week?
* How does accidents per capita look across the states?
* How does total number of accidents vary across the states?
